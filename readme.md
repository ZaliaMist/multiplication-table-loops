Write an HTML page that uses JavaScript to draw a 10x10 multiplication table. The key idea is to use two nested loops (one loop inside another) for the rows and columns of the table.

Step Two
Using a while loop, create the next row of the table by modifying main.js
 
Hint: The first box should have the class="cell header" while the rest of the boxes should only have class="cell"
 
Step Three
Create a second while loop which contains the while loop from step two. 
These should be a nested loop just like from the Nested Loops section of the reading.
